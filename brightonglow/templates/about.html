            <h2>Welcome to Brighton GLOW</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Where skincare meets simplicity, and glowing skin is always in.</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Inspired by the fresh, natural energy of Brighton, we believe that great skincare should be effortless, effective, and, most importantly, enjoyable.
                No complicated 10-step routines, no confusing ingredientsâ€”just products that work, fit seamlessly into your lifestyle, and leave you feeling radiant every day.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We know that life is busy, and skincare should be something you look forward to, not another task on your to-do list. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve curated a collection of products that make it easy to feel confident in your own skinâ€”because when you glow, you shine.
                Whether you're after a dewy morning look, a self-care Sunday ritual, or a simple way to refresh your routine, Brighton Glow is here to help.
                Hereâ€™s to glowing skin and effortless beautyâ€”because you deserve it.</p>
                <p>For advice on how to best layer your skincare, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/beauty/skin/a32689873/what-order-skincare/">check out this article</a> to which we contributed.</p>
