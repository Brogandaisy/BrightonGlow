## About Brighton Glow
Brighton Glow is an online skincare website offering a curated selection of skincare products, inspired by the fresh and natural vibe of Brighton. Their goal is to make it easy for people to find skincare products that help them feel confident and look their best. They believe in keeping things simple and accessible, offering products that fit into your everyday routine and leave your skin glowing.

Customers can browse products by category (moisturisers, serums, masks, gift sets, etc.), filter by skin type, and add multiple products to their shopping bag. The platform provides a seamless check-out experience powered by Stripe, allowing secure transactions using webhooks. Registered users can log in to view their orders and update their details.

The site is built using Django and deployed via Heroku, utilising MySQL as the database and AWS for media storage.
